## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   PHP >= 8.2
*   Composer
*   Node.js >= 20
*   npm (Node Package Manager)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Ultimate-Organizer
    ```

2.  **Install PHP Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Environment Configuration:**
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Generate an application key:
        ```bash
        php artisan key:generate
        ```
    *   Configure your database connection in the `.env` file. By default, it uses SQLite. If you prefer MySQL or PostgreSQL, update the `DB_CONNECTION` and other relevant `DB_` variables.
        ```dotenv
        DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
        # DB_DATABASE=/path/to/your/database.sqlite # For SQLite, default is database/database.sqlite
        # For MySQL:
        # DB_CONNECTION=mysql
        # DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
        # DB_PORT=3306
        # DB_DATABASE=laravel
        # DB_USERNAME=root
        # DB_PASSWORD=
        ```

5.  **Run Database Migrations and Seeders:**
    This will create the necessary tables and populate them with initial data, including an admin user.
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

6.  **Create Storage Symlink:**
    This is crucial for accessing uploaded images (e.g., Baju Adat) and generated invoices.
    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

7.  **Start the Development Servers:**
    You'll need to run both the Laravel development server and the Vite frontend server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command uses `concurrently` to run `php artisan serve`, `php artisan queue:listen`, and `vite` simultaneously.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once the development servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser:

*   **Application URL:** `http://localhost:8000` (or the URL provided by `php artisan serve`)

### Default Credentials

An admin user is created by the seeder:

*   **Email:** `admin@uo.com`
*   **Password:** `admin123`

You can register new `user` accounts directly from the login page.
